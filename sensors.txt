//SENSORS//
- It can detect the physical parameters and converts into electrical signal. 
 (physical parameters = light,heat,pressure or other environmental phenomena)
- Sensors are used to measure temperature,detect smoke and regulate pressure.
- It senses the presence or absence of energy.
- In Embedded system,sensor network embedded computers placed in physical 
  world that interacts with the Environment.
- In Robot Sensors,it will used to measure the condition of robot and 
  its surroundings environment.
// TYPES OF SENSORS //
- IR SENSORS   : Detects IR Radiation.
                 Range= (1-5 meters/3-1 feet).
                 Used in Remote sensing,night vision devices,optical power meters.
                 Pins Used:- GND,VCC,Digital output.

- SOUND         Detects Sound.
      SENSORS : Range= 3kHz to 6KHz.
                 Used in Security system for office/Home,Smart Phones,
                 provides i/p to Buffer,security.
                 Pins Used:- GND,Power supply,o/p pin.

- FLAME/FIRE     Detector can use electronic circuit by using receiver like
                 ElectroMagnetic Radiation.
     SENSORS:     Range= 760-1100 nanometer.
                 Used in Hydrogen stations,industrial gas turbines,gas-fueled cookers.
